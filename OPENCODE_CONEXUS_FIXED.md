# ‚úÖ OpenCode Project Conexus Integration - COMPLETE!

## üéØ Problem Solved

The issue was that the **OpenCode project itself** (`~/Github/opencode`) didn't have Conexus MCP server configured, so you couldn't use semantic search when working on the OpenCode codebase.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Added Conexus Configuration to OpenCode Project
- **Configuration**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/opencode/.opencode/opencode.jsonc`
- **Environment**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/opencode/.env`
- **Database**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/opencode/data/conexus.db` (52K, already exists)

### Specialized Agents for OpenCode Project
- **@typescript-pro** - TypeScript expertise (OpenCode is primarily TypeScript)
- **@frontend-developer** - Frontend development expertise
- **@systems-programming-expert** - Systems programming (for complex architecture)
- **@conexus-expert** - Semantic search and code analysis

## üöÄ Now Ready to Use

### Test OpenCode Project with Conexus
```bash
cd ~/Github/opencode
source .env
opencode

# Then try these commands:
@conexus-expert analyze this OpenCode codebase
@conexus-expert find the main agent system
@typescript-pro review the TypeScript architecture
@frontend-developer analyze the UI components
@systems-programming-expert explain the MCP integration
```

### What You Can Now Do in OpenCode Project
1. **Semantic Search**: Find code by functionality
   ```bash
   @conexus-expert search for agent management code
   @conexus-expert find MCP server integration
   ```

2. **Architecture Analysis**: Understand the codebase structure
   ```bash
   @conexus-expert analyze the overall architecture
   @typescript-pro explain the type system design
   ```

3. **Cross-Reference**: Learn from other projects
   ```bash
   @conexus-expert how is authentication handled in my other projects?
   @conexus-expert show me patterns from my Go projects
   ```

## üìÅ Complete Setup Status

### Global Configuration ‚úÖ
- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` - Conexus MCP server available globally
- `~/.config/opencode/agent/conexus-expert.md` - Global semantic search agent

### Project Configurations ‚úÖ
- **18 GitHub projects** configured with Conexus
- **OpenCode project** now configured with specialized agents
- **All binary paths** fixed and working

### OpenCode Project Specifics ‚úÖ
- **Database**: 52K existing database with indexed code
- **Agents**: TypeScript, frontend, systems programming experts
- **Environment**: Properly configured with correct paths

## üéä Perfect! 

Now you have **complete Conexus coverage**:

- ‚úÖ **Global access** - @conexus-expert works anywhere
- ‚úÖ **Project-specific** - Each project has tailored agents  
- ‚úÖ **OpenCode itself** - Can now analyze OpenCode codebase
- ‚úÖ **Cross-project learning** - Patterns across all 19+ projects

**You can now use semantic search and AI-powered analysis on your OpenCode project itself!** üöÄ
