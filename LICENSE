### Licensor

The person or entity offering the Software under these Terms and Conditions.

### Software

The software the Licensor makes available under these Terms and Conditions.

### License Grant

Subject to your compliance with this License Grant and the Patents, Redistribution and Trademark clauses below, the Licensor grants you the right to use, copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Software.

### Use Limitation

The Software is provided for non-commercial and commercial use, except that you may not use the Software for a Competing Use. A Competing Use means use of the Software in or for a commercial product or service that competes with the Software or any other product or service offered by Licensor using the Software.

### Patents

To the extent your use for a non-Competing Use would necessarily infringe a patent claim the Licensor can license without payment to a third party, the Licensor grants you a license under that patent claim. However, your license for that patent claim terminates if you make any patent claim against the Licensor or the Software.

### Redistribution

The Terms and Conditions apply to all copies, modifications, and derivative works of the Software.

### Disclaimer

The Software is provided "as-is" with no warranties of any kind.

### Trademark

You may not use the marks of the Licensor in any way that suggests your product or service is the Licensor's, or otherwise indicates any relationship between the Licensor and you.

### Future License

On the two-year anniversary of the first publication of this version of the Software, or on the two-year anniversary of a release of this version of the Software, or when the Licensor ceases to support the Software or the Licensor (or any successor of the Licensor), the License Grant automatically becomes a grant of rights under the terms of the MIT License for that version of the Software.
