type LifecycleHook interface {
    OnPreInit(ctx context.Context, connector Connector) error
    OnPostInit(ctx context.Context, connector Connector) error
    OnPreShutdown(ctx context.Context, connector Connector) error
    OnPostShutdown(ctx context.Context, connector Connector) error

## Next: Task 8.6 - Performance ## Next: Task 8.5 - Multi-Source Result Federation Observability

**Status**: 📋 PLANNED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours  
**GitHub Issue**: #60

### Objective
Support querying multiple external connectors simultaneously with result merging, deduplication, and cross-source relationship detection.

### Current State
- ✅ Connector CRUD operations working (Task 8.2)
- ✅ Connector lifecycle hooks working (Task 8.4)
- ❌ No multi-source query support
- ❌ No result merging/deduplication
- ❌ No cross-source relationship detection

### Requirements

#### 1. Multi-Source Query Execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Query all active connectors concurrently
- **Timeout Handling**: Per-connector timeouts with graceful degradation
- **Error Recovery**: Continue on partial failures
- **Result Aggregation**: Merge results from all sources

#### 2. Result Deduplication
- **Content Hashing**: Deduplicate identical content across sources
- **Similarity Detection**: Merge near-duplicate results
- **Source Attribution**: Track origin of each result
- **Ranking**: Score and rank merged results

#### 3. Cross-Source Relationships
- **ID Mapping**: Detect same entity across different connectors
- **Reference Resolution**: Link tickets/issues across systems
- **Dependency Tracking**: Build cross-source dependency graph
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Combine metadata from all sources

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Federation API (2h)
1. Create `internal/federation` package

4. Add metadata enrichment

#### Phase 4: Testing (1-2h)
1. Unit tests for federation (20+ tests)
2. Test parallel execution
3. Test deduplication
4. Test relationship detection
5. Target 80%+ coverage
