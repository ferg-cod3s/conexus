## Risk Management

### Known Risks

1. **Protocol Test Timeouts** (LOW impact)
   - Mitigation: Make Task 5.4 optional
   - Workaround: Document and defer

2. **Integration Test Complexity** (MEDIUM impact)
   - Mitigation: Start with simple workflows
   - Workaround: Focus on happy path first

3. **Documentation Scope Creep** (LOW impact)
   - Mitigation: Define clear scope per document
   - Workaround: Defer advanced topics to Phase 6

4. **Performance Overhead** (MEDIUM impact)
   - Mitigation: Profile validation/profiling overhead
   - Workaround: Add configuration to disable in dev mode

### Contingency Plans

- If integration tests too complex: Split Task 5.1 into Phase 5 & 6
- If documentation takes too long: Prioritize README and defer guides
- If workflow integration has issues: Add feature flags for gradual rollout
