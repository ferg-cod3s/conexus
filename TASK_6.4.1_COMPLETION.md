**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Coverage**: 80.4% (exceeds 80% target)

## Summary

Successfully implemented and validated the SQLite-backed vector store with full CRUD operations, FTS5 integration, and comprehensive test coverage. All 18 tests passing with proper concurrent access handling.

## Implementation Details

  └── store_test.go   (552 lines) - Test suite

### Features Implemented

**Core CRUD Operations:**
- ✅ `NewStore(path)` - Database initialization with schema setup
- ✅ `Upsert(ctx, doc)` - Insert or update single document
- ✅ `UpsertBatch(ctx, docs)` - Transactional batch operations
- ✅ `Delete(ctx, id)` - Remove document and FTS5 entry
- ✅ `Get(ctx, id)` - Retrieve document by ID
- ✅ `Count(ctx)` - Total document count
- ✅ `Close()` - Proper resource cleanup

**Schema Features:**
- ✅ Main `documents` table with JSON vector/metadata storage
- ✅ FTS5 virtual table `documents_fts` for full-text search
- ✅ Auto-sync triggers (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to keep FTS5 current
- ✅ Indexes on `created_at` and `updated_at` for time-based queries
- ✅ Language-specific metadata extraction for stats

**Quality Features:**
- ✅ Context-aware operations with cancellation support
- ✅ Proper error wrapping with descriptive messages
- ✅ Transaction rollback on batch failures
- ✅ Concurrent access safety via connection pool configuration
- ✅ Stats provider with language breakdown

### Test Coverage

**18 Test Functions Covering:**
- Store initialization (in-memory and file-based)
- Upsert operations (insert, update, validation, cancellation)
- Batch operations (multiple docs, empty batch, validation, updates)
- Delete operations (existing, non-existent, FTS5 sync)
- Get operations (existing, not found)
- Count operations (empty, with data)
- Stats operations (empty, with language metadata)
- FTS5 integration (triggers on insert/update)
- Placeholder search methods (vector, BM25, hybrid)
- Resource cleanup (Close)
- Concurrent access (10 goroutines, 100 ops/each)

**Coverage Breakdown:**
```
NewStore        66.7% (error paths tested separately)
initSchema     100.0%
Upsert          80.6%
UpsertBatch     83.3%
upsertInTx      76.2%
Delete          77.8%
Get             81.2%
Count          100.0%
Close          100.0%
SearchVector   100.0% (placeholder)
SearchBM25     100.0% (placeholder)
SearchHybrid   100.0% (placeholder)
Stats           78.6%
----------------------------
TOTAL           80.4%
```

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Timestamp Test Failure
**Problem**: `TestStore_Upsert/update_existing_document` failed because `UpdatedAt.After(CreatedAt)` assertion failed.

**Root Cause**: Unix timestamps have 1-second granularity, but test only waited 10ms between insert and update operations.

**Fix**: Changed sleep duration from `10 * time.Millisecond` to `1 * time.Second` in store_test.go line 87.

**Result**: Test now passes consistently (1.02s duration).

### Issue #2: Concurrent Access Test Failure
**Problem**: `TestStore_ConcurrentAccess/concurrent_upserts` failed with "no such table: documents" errors from all goroutines.

**Root Cause**: SQLite `:memory:` databases create separate database instances per connection when accessed concurrently. Each goroutine gets a different connection from the pool, sees an empty database without schema.

**Investigation**:
- Created minimal reproduction test confirming the issue
- Verified that each connection in the pool gets its own in-memory database
- Confirmed file-based databases don't have this issue (shared by filename)

**Fix**: Added `db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)` in `NewStore()` to force all connections to share the same in-memory database.

```go
// For :memory: databases, limit to 1 connection to ensure all goroutines
// share the same database. Without this, the connection pool creates separate
// in-memory databases per connection, causing "no such table" errors.
db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)
```

**Secondary Fix**: Changed document ID generation in test from `string(rune('a' + id))` to `fmt.Sprintf("doc%d", id)` (old method only worked for id < 26).

**Result**: All goroutines successfully share the same database, test passes with 1,000 total operations (10 goroutines × 100 ops each).

## Technical Decisions

### JSON Storage for Vectors
- Stored embeddings as JSON arrays instead of binary blobs
- Trade-off: Slight storage overhead for easier debugging/inspection
- Performance impact minimal for typical embedding sizes (384-1536 dims)

### Connection Pool Configuration
- Set `MaxOpenConns(1)` for `:memory:` databases only
- File-based databases can use default connection pooling
- No performance impact in production (single connection sufficient for typical usage)

### Transaction Strategy
- Individual upserts use single statements (no explicit transaction overhead)
- Batch operations wrap all inserts in a single transaction
- Rollback on any failure ensures atomic batch behavior

### Error Handling
- All operations return wrapped errors with context
- Database constraint violations properly surfaced
- Context cancellation respected throughout

## Next Steps

### Task 6.4.2: BM25 Full-Text Search
**Files to Create:**
- `internal/vectorstore/sqlite/fts5.go` (~150 lines)
- `internal/vectorstore/sqlite/fts5_test.go` (~200 lines)

**Scope:**
- Implement `SearchBM25(ctx, query, filters, limit)` method
- Use FTS5 `MATCH` queries against `documents_fts` table
- Parse and escape user queries for FTS5 syntax
- Apply relevance ranking using built-in `rank` column
- Support metadata filters via JOIN with main documents table
- Handle edge cases: empty queries, special characters, phrase queries

### Task 6.4.3: Vector Similarity Search
**Files to Modify:**
- Implement `SearchVector()` with cosine similarity
- Implement `SearchHybrid()` combining BM25 + vector search

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: 405 (implementation) + 552 (tests) = 957 total
- **Test Coverage**: 80.4% (exceeds 80% target)
- **Test Count**: 18 functions, 30 subtests
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Low (simple CRUD operations)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (only standard library + modernc.org/sqlite)
- **Performance**: Sub-2s test suite execution

## Validation

All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ CRUD operations implemented and tested
- ✅ FTS5 schema with auto-sync triggers
- ✅ Context-aware with proper cancellation
- ✅ Error handling with wrapped errors
- ✅ Concurrent access safety
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
