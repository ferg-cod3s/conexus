## üìù Notes

### Decision Points
- **After Task 7.7**: Decide whether to:
  - Deploy MVP and iterate (recommended for <5K doc use cases)
  - Continue to Phase 8 for enterprise features (>10K docs)
  
### Assumptions
- MVP target: 1K-5K document codebases ‚úÖ
- Enterprise target: 10K+ document codebases (Phase 8+)
- Single-instance deployment acceptable for MVP
- Multi-instance/HA required for enterprise
