PRD (Vision & Requirements)

Technical Architecture (How we build it)

API Specification (How we expose it)
  ↓
Security & Compliance (How we secure it)
  ↓
Development Roadmap (When we build it)
  ↓
Go-to-Market Strategy (How we sell it)
```

## Remaining Optional Tasks

### Low Priority PRD Refinements
While the PRD is functional, consider adding:
- [ ] Explicit timeline references (link to Development Roadmap)
- [ ] User personas (developer archetypes)
- [ ] Risk section (align with Security & GTM)
- [ ] Baseline metrics (current state analysis)
- [ ] Final branding decision (Synapse/Conexus/ACE)

**Recommendation:** These are nice-to-haves; current PRD is sufficient for project kickoff.
