   - Lines 122-124: Context accumulation in workflows
   - Full conversation history implementation

2. **Caching System** (`docs/architecture/context-engine-internals.md:9870-10127`)
   - Multi-level cache architecture
   - Cache promotion and invalidation strategies
   - Performance impact measurements

3. **Search Performance** (`internal/search/search.go`)
   - Lines 95-110: Hybrid search implementation
   - Parallel dense and sparse retrieval
   - Fusion strategies for result combination

4. **Load Testing** (`tests/load/results/STRESS_TEST_ANALYSIS.md`)
   - Concurrent user support validation
   - Performance under sustained load
   - System resilience measurements

## Verification Instructions

Users can verify these metrics by running:

```bash
# Performance benchmarks
cd tests/load
./run_benchmarks.sh

# Current system performance
go test -bench=. ./...

# View detailed metrics
cat PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md

# Check integration tests
go test ./internal/testing/integration
```
