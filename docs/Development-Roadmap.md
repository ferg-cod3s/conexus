# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development strategy for Conexus (Agentic Context Engine), an open-source RAG system designed for AI coding assistants. The project aims to deliver a high-performance, scalable solution with <1s query latency supporting 100+ concurrent users, built on Go, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Qdrant, and hybrid RAG with MCP + REST APIs. The business model follows a community-led open-core approach: OSS → Enterprise → Scale.

**Total Timeline:** 18-20 months  
**Key Metrics:** 
- Unit test coverage: 80-90%
- Performance: <1s query latency, 100+ concurrent users
- Security: SOC 2 compliance for enterprise tier

## Team Sizing & Resource Requirements

### Core Team Composition (6-8 Engineers)
- **Backend (Go) Engineers:** 2-3 (Lead: Go microservices, concurrency, API design)
- **RAG/ML Specialists:** 2 (Lead: Vector search, embeddings, hybrid RAG optimization)
- **Frontend/API Engineers:** 1-2 (Lead: REST/MCP API development, dashboard UI)
- **DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer:** 1 (Lead: AWS/GCP deployment, monitoring, scaling)

### Skills Matrix by Phase

### Contingency Plans
- **Delay in Phase 1:** Extend MVP by 1 month; focus on core pipeline only
- **Team shortage:** Prioritize Backend and RAG roles; outsource DevOps
- **External dependency failure:** Maintain compatibility matrix; plan open-source alternatives

### Overall Go/No-Go Criteria
