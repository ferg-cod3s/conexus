# Security & Compliance Framework

## 1. Open-Source Core Security Model (Trust through Transparency)

**Local-First Processing:** All indexing, storage, and retrieval operations for the open-source version are performed **locally on the user's machine**. This architecture minimizes attack surfaces by keeping sensitive data within the user's control.

**No Data Exfiltration:** The core engine will not make any network calls to a third-party server with user code or private data. All operations are self-contained. The only external calls are to the LLM provider, initiated by the client, ensuring that proprietary code remains local.

**Privacy-First Architecture:** We will follow Cursor's model: if and when a cloud component is introduced, it will store only embeddings with obfuscated filenames. The actual source code snippets will be requested from the local client on-demand and never persisted on servers.

**Dependency Security:** All dependencies will be scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Dependabot as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Critical vulnerabilities must be addressed within 30 days, with automated alerts for high-severity issues.

**Secure Contribution:** All PRs will require a review from a core maintainer, with a focus on security implications. Automated security scans (SAST/DAST) will be integrated into the CI pipeline to prevent insecure code from merging.

## 2. Commercial Enterprise Edition Security Features

This layer provides the robust security and compliance features required by large organizations, building on the open-source foundation with enterprise-grade controls.

**Context-Based Access Control (CBAC):**    
*   **Implementation:** During ingestion, connectors will fetch permission metadata (e.g., from GitHub teams or Confluence page restrictions). This metadata will be stored alongside the vectors.    
*   **Enforcement:** At query time, the engine will authenticate the user (via SSO) and filter all retrieval results against their permissions *before* the reranking stage. This ensures that no unauthorized information ever enters the context window.

**Authentication:** Integration with enterprise identity providers via **SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for Single Sign-On (SSO). For optional multi-user mode, JWT tokens and API keys are supported with configurable expiration and rotation policies.

**Multi-Tenant Isolation:** In the managed cloud version, tenants will be strictly isolated using separate database schemas/namespaces and tenant-specific encryption keys for data at rest. Network segmentation ensures no cross-tenant data leakage.

**Compliance & Auditing:**    
*   The service will be designed to be **SOC 2 Type II** compliant.    
*   A comprehensive **audit log** will be maintained, recording every query and all context data accessed by each user for security monitoring and compliance.

## 3. Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is integral to the Conexus system's security posture, identifying potential risks and guiding mitigation strategies. We employ multiple methodologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### STRIDE Threat Model Analysis

STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) analysis for the Conexus system:

- **Spoofing:** Risk of identity impersonation via compromised JWT tokens or API keys. Mitigation: Implement token validation with short expiration times (e.g., 15 minutes) and refresh token rotation. Use cryptographic signatures to verify token integrity.
  
- **Tampering:** Potential alteration of data in transit or at rest. Mitigation: Enforce TLS 1.3 for all network communications. Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest in PostgreSQL/SQLite databases. Implement integrity checks using HMAC for stored vectors.

- **Repudiation:** Users denying actions performed. Mitigation: Comprehensive audit logging with tamper-evident storage using blockchain-based hashing or append-only databases. Log all authentication events, queries, and data access with timestamps and user identifiers.

- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive code or embeddings. Mitigation: CBAC ensures permission-based filtering. Encrypt sensitive data fields and implement data loss prevention (DLP) rules to prevent exfiltration.

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Resource exhaustion attacks on the system. Mitigation: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints (e.g., 100 requests/minute per user). Use circuit breakers for external LLM calls. Deploy auto-scaling with resource quotas.

- **Elevation of Privilege:** Unauthorized access escalation. Mitigation: Enforce least privilege principles in role-based access control (RBAC). Regularly audit permissions and implement just-in-time access for administrative functions.

### PASTA Methodology Application

PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) provides a risk-centric view:

1. **Define Objectives:** Protect intellectual property, ensure data privacy, maintain system availability.
2. **Define Technical Scope:** Local-first architecture with optional cloud components, integrations with PostgreSQL/SQLite, external secrets providers (Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault), OpenTelemetry observability.
3. **Application Decomposition:** Break down into components: ingestion connectors, vector database, query engine, authentication layer, audit system.
4. **Threat Analysis:** Identify threats like injection attacks on connectors, side-channel attacks on encrypted data, supply chain compromises.
5. **Vulnerability Analysis:** Assess weaknesses in dependencies, configuration management, and third-party integrations.
6. **Attack Modeling:** Simulate attack paths, such as compromising a connector to inject malicious data or exploiting LLM API keys.
7. **Risk Analysis:** Prioritize risks using CVSS scoring, focusing on high-impact threats like data breaches.
8. **Mitigation Strategy:** Map controls to threats, ensuring defense-in-depth with multiple layers (network, application, data).

### Attack Surface Analysis

- **Network Surface:** API endpoints for queries and ingestion. Mitigation: Restrict to HTTPS only, implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules for common attacks.
- **Data Surface:** Vector embeddings and metadata. Mitigation: Encryption at rest, access controls, and data anonymization where possible.
- **Code Surface:** Open-source components vulnerable to supply chain attacks. Mitigation: Regular dependency scanning, signed releases, and reproducible builds.
- **User Surface:** Authentication interfaces. Mitigation: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enterprise users, CAPTCHA for public-facing elements.
- **Third-Party Surface:** LLM providers and secrets managers. Mitigation: API key rotation, monitoring for anomalous usage, and fallback mechanisms.

### Threat Mitigation Strategies

- **Automated Scanning:** Integrate SAST (e.g., SonarQube), DAST (e.g., OWASP ZAP), and dependency scanning into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture:** Verify all access requests, regardless of origin. Use micro-segmentation for cloud deployments.
- **Incident Response:** Develop playbooks for common threats, with automated alerting via OpenTelemetry integration.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Use security information and event management (SIEM) to correlate threats across logs.

## 4. Regulatory Compliance Details

Conexus is designed to support multiple regulatory frameworks, with configurable controls for enterprise deployments.
