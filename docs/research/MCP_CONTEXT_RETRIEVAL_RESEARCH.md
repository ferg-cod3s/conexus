# MCP Context Retrieval Research Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive research plan to improve the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server's context retrieval and management capabilities. The goal is to enhance how AI agents access and utilize contextual information from codebases, documentation, and collaborative workflows.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths of Current Implementation

The Conexus MCP server demonstrates a solid foundation with several advanced features:

1. **Hybrid Retrieval System**
   - Combines dense vector search with sparse BM25 keyword matching
   - Parallel execution for optimal performance (20-50ms latency)
   - Multiple fusion strategies (RRF, weighted combination)

2. **Multi-Tier Caching Architecture**
   - L1: In-memory cache (85% hit rate, <1ms latency)
   - L2: Redis distributed cache (10% hit rate, 1-3ms latency)
   - L3: Persistent disk cache (3% hit rate, 5-15ms latency)
   - Overall cache hit rate: 98%

3. **Work Context Integration**
   - Active file boosting
   - Git branch awareness
   - Open ticket ID support
   - Story ID tracking

4. **Advanced Tooling**
   - `context.search`: Hybrid search with filters
   - `context.explain`: Detailed code explanations
   - `context.grep`: Fast pattern matching
   - `context.get_related_info`: File/ticket history
   - `context.index_control`: Index management
   - `context.connector_management`: Data source management

### Identified Improvement Opportunities

1. **Context Window Management**: Static token allocation without intelligent prioritization
2. **Query Understanding**: Limited intent classification and query expansion
3. **Contextual Retrieval**: Basic work context without dependency awareness
4. **Ranking Optimization**: Fixed-weight scoring without learning capabilities
5. **Chunk Strategy**: Fixed chunking without adaptive boundaries
6. **Cache Intelligence**: TTL-based caching without semantic awareness
7. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: No shared context state management

## Research Areas
