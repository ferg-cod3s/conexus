# Product Requirements Document: The Agentic Context Engine

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles

### Vision
To create the standard, open-source context engine that transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into expert engineering assistants. We will empower a global community to connect the world's development knowledge while offering a secure, enterprise-grade managed service for commercial users.

### Guiding Principles

**Context is the Product**
We are moving beyond prompt engineering. Our success is defined by our ability to find and assemble the most relevant, permission-safe information into the context window at the right time.

**Trust Through Transparency**
The core engine and its connectors will always be open-source, allowing for complete security and privacy auditing. We will adopt privacy-first architectures, never persisting sensitive source code on our servers.

**Embrace Open Standards**
We will be a first-class citizen of the modern AI ecosystem by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as our primary integration layer.

**Community-Driven Extensibility**
Our platform's strength comes from its connectors. We will build a simple, powerful framework that empowers the community to integrate the long tail of developer tools.

**Systematic Evaluation**
Every component, from retrieval to generation, will be built with a corresponding evaluation suite to drive continuous, metric-based improvement.

## 2. The Problem: The Context Gap

Modern LLM assistants are powerful but operate with a critical "context gap." They lack a deep understanding of:

- **The "Why" Behind the Code**: The architectural decisions, rejected alternatives, and business logic discussed in Slack, Jira, and PR reviews.
- **Cross-System Connections**: The implicit graph connecting a bug report in GitHub Issues, the diagnostic discussion in Discord, and the resulting pull request.
- **The Developer's Immediate Focus**: The files, tasks, and conversations relevant to the developer's *current* work, which are often a tiny subset of the entire codebase.

This gap leads to generic suggestions, hallucinations, and a significant waste of developer time manually providing the very context the AI needs to be effective.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goal
To ship a product that provides a measurably superior developer experience over standard RAG-based coding assistants by delivering highly relevant, low-latency context.

### Core Objectives

**Objective 1: Real-Time Ingestion**
Develop a file-system watcher and Git connector to perform real-time indexing of local codebases, using Merkle trees for efficient change detection.

**Objective 2: Working Context Awareness**
Implement a "Work Graph" that identifies the user's currently active files, repository, and associated issue tracker ticket to dramatically narrow the search space.

**Objective 3: Advanced Retrieval & Ranking**
Build a two-stage retrieval pipeline using hybrid search (BM25 + vector) for candidate selection and a cross-encoder for high-precision reranking. Implement Anthropic's "Contextual Retrieval" by prepending explanatory context to chunks before embedding.

**Objective 4: Standards-Based Integration**
Expose the engine's functionality as a standards-compliant MCP server, and package it into a Claude Code `/plugin` for a seamless, one-command installation experience.

## 4. Core Architecture & Features

The engine is architected as a standalone service with three primary interfaces: an MCP Server, a REST API, and a packaged Claude Code `/plugin`.

### The Open Source Core Engine

#### 1. Data Preparation & Ingestion
- Real-time file system indexing using Merkle trees to efficiently track changes
- Connectors for Git, GitHub Issues, and Slack
- Semantic Chunking: Use Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for code and logical boundaries (paragraphs, sections) for documents
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Prepend chunk-specific explanatory context before embedding to improve retrieval accuracy

#### 2. Understanding the Working Context
- Dynamically identify the user's "work graph" by monitoring active files in the IDE, the current Git branch, and any referenced ticket numbers (e.g., `feat/PROJ-123-new-feature`)
- Use this work graph to heavily prioritize search results from relevant files and conversations

#### 3. First-Pass Retrieval & Reranking
**Two-Stage Retrieval Pipeline:**
- **Stage 1 (Retrieval)**: Hybrid search combining dense vector search (e.g., Gemini/Voyage embeddings) with sparse keyword search (BM25) to retrieve ~100-150 candidates
- **Stage 2 (Reranking)**: Use a high-performance cross-encoder model (e.g., Cohere or open-source equivalent) to rerank candidates and select the top 20 for the final context

#### 4. Interface Layer
- **MCP Server**: The primary interface, exposing `tools` (e.g., `search_code`, `get_related_discussions`) and `resources` (e.g., browsable file trees) via JSON-RPC over stdio and HTTP
- **Claude Code /plugin**: A declarative wrapper that bundles the MCP server with slash commands (`/search_context`) and hooks (e.g., auto-index on file save)

### The Commercial Enterprise Edition

#### 1. Advanced Security & Compliance
- **Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)**: Implement permission-aware RAG by tagging vectors with access metadata and filtering results at query time based on the user's authenticated identity
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Strict data isolation between tenants using separate namespaces and encryption keys
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all queries and data access for compliance

#### 2. Advanced Context & Memory
- **GraphRAG**: Augment vector retrieval with a knowledge graph to understand relationships between code, tickets, and discussions
- **Persistent Memory**: Implement a long-term memory system (e.g., LangGraph) to enable true agentic behavior across sessions

#### 3. Managed Service & Support
- A fully managed, scalable cloud deployment of the context engine
- Enterprise support with guaranteed SLAs for uptime and performance
- Centralized management dashboard for analytics and observability

## 5. Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of active open-source users and plugin installations
- GitHub stars and community engagement
- Number of community-contributed connectors

### Performance Metrics
- End-to-end latency for a standard query: **< 1 second**
- Retrieval quality target: **Recall@5 > 90%** on our internal evaluation benchmark
- Query throughput: Support for concurrent queries from multiple users

### User Satisfaction
- Qualitative feedback from the community indicating that the context provided is significantly more relevant than that of competing tools
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) for enterprise customers
- Retention rate for enterprise subscriptions

## 6. Non-Goals

To maintain focus, the following are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial release:

- **Code Generation**: The engine provides context; it does not generate or execute code
- **Direct LLM Integration**: The engine does not call LLMs directly; it supplies context to external LLM clients
- **Project Management Features**: We are not building a project management tool; we index existing tools
- **Custom Embedding Training**: We will use existing, state-of-the-art embedding models rather than training custom models

## 7. Open Questions & Future Research

- **Optimal Chunk Size**: What is the ideal chunk size for different types of content (code vs. documentation)?
- **Embedding Model Selection**: Should we support multiple embedding models or standardize on one?
- **Cost vs. Quality Trade-offs**: What is the acceptable cost per query for the commercial service?
- **GraphRAG Implementation**: Which graph database provides the best performance for our use case?

## 8. Project Name & Branding

This section outlines two primary naming candidates for the project. The final name will be selected based on brand resonance, memorability, and community feedback.

### Option 1: Synapse

**Tagline:** Synapse: The Context Protocol for AI.

**Core Concept:** This name uses a powerful metaphor from neuroscience. A synapse is the junction where signals pass between neurons, enabling communication and thought. The project acts as the synapse for an AI, connecting scattered pieces of knowledge (code, docs, conversations) into a coherent whole.

**Pros:**

   **Powerful Metaphor:** Immediately evokes concepts of intelligence, connection, speed, and the "nervous system" of AI.

   **Memorable:** A single, strong, and easy-to-remember word.

   **Sophisticated:** Sounds intelligent and technically advanced, aligning with a cutting-edge AI project.

**Cons:**

   **Metaphorical, Not Literal:** Does not explicitly mention "context," so the function isn't immediately obvious from the name alone.

   **Potential SEO Challenges:** As a common biological term, it may be harder to rank for in search engines without a specific qualifier (e.g., "Synapse AI").

**Possible Logo Concepts:**

   **A. Abstract Neural Connection:** A central node with lines radiating outwards to connect with smaller, surrounding nodes, representing the gathering of context into a central nexus.

   **B. Stylized Spark:** A minimalist and clean icon of a spark or a lightning bolt, symbolizing the moment of connection, insight, and activation.

   **C. Literal Synapse:** A highly stylized and simplified graphic of two neurons with an energy pulse connecting them.

### Option 2: Conexus

**Tagline:** Conexus: The Context Engine for Modern Development.

**Core Concept:** A unique and brandable portmanteau of the two core ideas: **Con**text and **Nexus**. It positions the project as the central point where all development context comes together.

**Pros:**

   **Unique and Brandable:** A made-up word that is easy to own from a branding, domain, and trademark perspective.

   **Clever and Relevant:** The meaning is baked into the name itself, making it highly relevant once explained.

   **Modern Feel:** Short, sleek, and follows a common and successful naming pattern in the tech industry.

**Cons:**

   **Not Immediately Obvious:** The meaning is not apparent without a brief explanation.

   **Potential for Misspelling:** Could be misspelled (e.g., "Connexus," "Konexus") by users unfamiliar with the name.

**Possible Logo Concepts:**

   **A. Interlocking Shapes:** Two abstract shapes (perhaps representing a 'C' and an 'N') that interlock or weave together, visually representing the act of combining and unifying.

   **B. Converging Pathways:** A series of lines or data streams that flow from various points and converge into a single, cohesive shape at the center.

   **C. Typographic Focus:** A wordmark logo where the 'x' is stylized to represent a connection point, a node, or a spark, emphasizing the "nexus" at the heart of the name.
