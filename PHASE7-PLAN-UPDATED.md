- ✅ Path traversal prevented
- ✅ Command injection prevented
- ✅ 109/109 tests passing

   - Implementation: Token bucket or sliding window

4. **Add Resource Limits** (Priority: P1)
   - Target: Agent process spawning
   - Limits: Memory, CPU, file handles, execution time
   - Implementation: cgroups or resource monitoring

5. **Enhanced Audit Logging** (Priority: P2)
